## Description

This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight.
The initial dataset contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disaster. 
The aim of the project is to build a Natural Language Processing tool that categorize messages.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories
3. Web App to show model results in real time.
